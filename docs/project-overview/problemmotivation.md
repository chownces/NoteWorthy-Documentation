# Project Overview

## Problem Motivation
As university students, we are very selective of where we write our notes. Although there are many note taking apps out there, each one
only truly excels in their own unique form of note taking (e.g. OneNote for handwritten notes, Google Docs for collaboration, Notion for
database-style organisation). Worse still, some feature-rich ones require subscription fees. This can be annoying for university
students, who are forced to make a compromise between features and also cost. 

We have identified a core set of features that students seek in their note-taking apps. Offering superb organisation, the ability to jot
on the go, easy collaboration, and time management features, NoteWorthy combines the best features of note taking apps out there into a
compelling package for students, by students.

## Proposed Core Features
1. Login into the app and retrieve their own notes
1. Collaborative editing of notes online, and link sharing
1. Upload pictures and screenshots
1. Feature that allows user to draw and insert the drawing as a picture within the app
